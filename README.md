COVID Data Analysis

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 datasets to uncover trends, patterns, and insights regarding the pandemic's impact across various regions. The analysis focuses on several key metrics, including case counts, mortality rates, testing rates, and vaccination progress. Data visualizations were created to highlight significant trends over time, and the dataset was cleaned and transformed to ensure consistency and accuracy for deeper analysis.

Key Objectives:
Analyze global and regional trends in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries.
Examine the relationship between testing rates, case rates, and population density.
Investigate vaccination progress and its correlation with case reduction.
Visualize key data trends with graphs for better insights.

Tools and Technologies:
SQL for data extraction, manipulation, and analysis, utilizing:
CTEs (Common Table Expressions) for organizing complex queries.
JOINS to combine data from multiple tables (e.g., cases, deaths, tests, and vaccinations).
Subqueries for performing nested queries and aggregating data efficiently.
Other fundamental SQL concepts such as GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY for summarizing and filtering data.

Microsoft Excel for further data manipulation and visualization.
